<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I'm a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) and a member of the IDEA LAB@UIUC led by [Prof. Hanghang Tong](http://tonghanghang.org/). Before that, I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science degree from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and B.Eng. degree in Automation from [Zhejiang University](http://www.cse.zju.edu.cn/).

My research lies in large-scale machine learning on graphs and its applications. Currently, I'm working on the intersection of graph ML and computational optimal transport.

If you are interested in my research, feel free to reach out to me via zhichenz@illinois.edu.
